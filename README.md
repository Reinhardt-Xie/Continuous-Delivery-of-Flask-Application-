1. This repo includes the demo video showing how to conduct continous delivery via AWS by using two modules called Elastic Beanstalk and code Pipeline.

2. The source code is showing how to create application and flask environment by using AWS CLI.

3. The repo also includes the documents called application.py and requirements.txt. The functions showing the contents and features on the webpage are written in the application.py, and applications needed during the deployment are included in the requirements.txt. Thus, you can directly use the documents and source code, and follow the instruction from the demo video to replicate the web application deployment.
